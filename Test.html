        <li> <b>Mclaren 720s</b></li>
        <p>The McLaren 720S is born of the McLaren design philosophy: everything for a reason. The powerful simplicity and integrity of this ethos shapes stunning cars. Through an intense, evolutionary process. The radical shape of the 720S is inspired by the teardrop. Nature’s perfect aerodynamic form. It takes this shape because it helps to deliver superlative performance. And aerodynamic efficiency. Every design detail is the same. Created to improve performance. Sharpen handling. Intensify engagement. Enhance comfort. Beautifully.</p>
